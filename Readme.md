## Description

A [DragonFrame](https://www.dragonframe.com) [LiveLink](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/live-link-in-unreal-engine/) plugin for [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com).

Still a WIP. Contact us if you'd like to contribute.

This plugin was developed for a stop-motion animation project here at RIT and our goal is to make it as easy as possible for other stop-motion animators to use it in their own projects.

We also plan to add support for our large-scale motion control camera rig powered by [Kuper](https://www.general-lift.com/Kuper/Kuper.html) control software and hardware.
